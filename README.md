# iOS Learning!

### Basic Information
* We will be following along with this course syllabus: [syllabus](https://github.com/IDMNYU/DMGY9103-MobileApps-SP15/blob/master/syllabus.md) but we'll be on wednesdays instead of Tuesdays.

### Getting Started
* [Sign up for an Apple Developer Account](https://developer.apple.com/register/index.action) if you don't have one
* Sign up for a [github account](http://github.com)
* Please fill out [this google form](http://goo.gl/forms/MnKIxzNEFX) with your account information
* Setup your git repository for textbook work (preferably public)


### Setting up your git Repository
(These are the instructions for setting up a public repository, which is recommended)

* Create a fork of this repository under your own github account (button is currently on the upper right of the page)
* On the page for your fork, copy the HTTPS Clone URL (should look like `https://github.com/YourGithubUsername/tanooki-ios-learning-spring-2015.git`)
* In your terminal, type the following commands (here's a basic [guide](https://mattwilcox.net/archives/a-very-basic-introduction-to-the-command-line-terminal-and-shell/) if you're just getting started):
* `cd place/you/want/to/do/your/work`
* `git clone https://github.com/YourGithubUsername/tanooki-ios-learning-spring-2015.git` (replace with your URL)
* `cd tanooki-ios-learning-spring-2015`
* `mkdir textbook_work/firstname_lastname` (please replace with your name)
* `touch textbook_work/firstname_lastname/.keep` (this just creates a blank file)
* `git add .`
* `git commit -m 'added my directory for textbook work, whooo!'`
* `git push origin master`


### Commiting Work

As you go through the book, you'll be coding along with the examples in the book. As a general rule, any time the author writes something like "now try running your code, it should work", and your code works, it is time to commit.
